secure-pbcopy -- pbcopy(1) replacement that marks data as confidential

Like pbcopy(1), takes the standard input and copies it to the system clipboard.
Unlike pbcopy, there is currently no support for specifying the target
pasteboard, nor the format of the data - it will always be interpreted as text.
